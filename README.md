## The Story Behind The Web App
> What's your motivation in making this?
While scrolling through various social media platforms, I realized many of the "Twitter wars" and spats in the Instagram comments were caused by miscommunication through impulsive messaging. In other words, people were posting & sending things without taking a second to reflect if their current state of emotion & word choice aligned. Because of this, I wanted to create something for people to not only check in with their emotions but also check to see what tones were present in any body of text.
> What languages and technologies are you using? If it's your first time using that language, how did you learn it? 
I used React+Vite, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, & CSS3 for the front-end, Express.js & Node.js for the backend, and used MongoDB for the application's database.

This project was the first time I used mostly TailwindCSS. At first, I'll admit, it was overwhelming, but after reading the official documentation, things got a lot easier from then on. This project was also the first time I used the [Select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select.git) library from react-select and I used the documentation present in this Git repo to learn how to integrate it into the application.
